Simple golf scorecard


## Set up and track your golf scores

This app is a basic app that can be used at any of Toronto's public golf courses (*at least until I find an API that lets me get other golf courses for free). It is written in React-Native using Expo.

## Run and enjoy

Clone the branch, install NodeJS dependencies, and npm run web will start up the Expo server and provide web access (you can also use mobile devices via QR code in the terminal)
